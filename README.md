# BTCUSD-predictive-model-LSTM
This project is part of my final assignment as Data Science student. This project focuses on building predictive model for BTC/USD using Long Short-Term Memory with additional technical indicators such as _Bollinger Bands_ and _Moving Average Convergence Divergence_ (MACD) as trading signal to improve model accuracy.
# Project Description
Bitcoin (BTC) is a digital asset known for its high price volatility. Predicting the price movements of Bitcoin is an interesting challenge especially with its price driven by many factors, such as news sentiment, trading volume, and other technical indicators.

The main objectives of this project are:
1. Predicting BTC/USD price using Long Short-Term Memory
2. Model optimization to improve predictive model accuracy

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is Bitcoin Historical Data for the period of February 2021 to February 2025 obtained from _investing.com_, which then will be feature engineered to provide technical indicators such as MACD and _Bollinger Bands_, which then will be used to improve the model's accuracy. 

# Tools Needed

1. **Python** : Main programming Language
2. **Jupyter Notebook** : To run program
3. **Pandas & Numpy** : For data handling and analysis
4. **Matplotlib** : Data visualization tool
5. **Tensorflow** : To implement LSTM
6. **MinMaxScaler** : To normalize data for LSTM input

# Results
1. Evaluation of the predictive model's accuracy using evaluation metrics (RMSE, MAE, and MAPE)
2. Visualization of BTC/USD prediction compared to the actual price movement.
